            <p>Since leaving the Marines in 2010 I have been in the supply chain industry where I have worked in everything from small pack to less than trucload to full truckload.
                However, the recent pandemic has made me reconsider that line of work, so I have decided to learn Web Development with the encourgment of some friends in already in the field. 
                I finished a bootcamp sponsered by Ohio State and operated by Trilogy. There I gained a solid foundation in web development. Although I know I have much more to learn, 
                I hope to take these new skills to a future career that I can be excited and proud to be in.</p>

            <p>Since leaving the Marines in 2010 I have been in the supply chain industry where I have worked in everything from small--
                The recent pandemic has made me reconsider that line of work, so I have decided to learn Web Development. 
                I am currently in a bootcamp that is teaching the skills that I will need to become a great developer. 
                I hope to take these new skills to a future career that I can be excited and proud to be in.</p>
